# GeoConformal Prediction

A powerful, model-agnostic tool to measure spatially varying uncertainty of machine learning models. GeoConfromal is an extension of Conformal prediction.

GeoConformal, in theory, supports any machine learning model with spatial (e.g., coordinates) and aspatial (e.g., area of the living) features as the input. Currently, classification models are not supported.
